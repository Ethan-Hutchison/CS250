1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Learning how to interpret a users needs can take time to learn and master. It comes down to having clear and open communcation with the end-user so that their needs can be clearly communicated to the team. Then taking time to design a system that would implement these changes well. User stories can assist with this by giving you clear guidelines for the project and then test for these user stories can be made.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

To approach developing programs I like to plan out the steps before hand and organize items by how difficult they may be. Then I will go after the Easier items first to get them out of the way and give myself time to work through the harder items. The agile processes I wish to incorporate in the future when I have a team are the daily meetings to keep communication flowing, and planning out items by estimating their size.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member you have to be willing to work with the others and help when you're needed. While you do have your own projects to work on it can help things run much smoother when you help others if you have time. Also a good team member is willing to work on a project with another person. They also will take on larger projects at times, not taking only small easy ones. And They will communicate with the team effectively and in a timely manner.
